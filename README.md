# Safe-Car

Hackathon Project

This is our Hackathon Project

1.	The project name is Safe Car:

•	The idea behind the project: There are some accidents that has happened because people have fainted because of heat strokes. Our main idea came from two different videos that we watched. The first video was about a parent and his child went to the car and the parent remembered that he forgot something in the house. He went in and left the child in the car. He saw a movie that he liked and sat and watched the movie and his child died in the car. The second video was an employee was late for his girlfriend, so he ran to his car and started to drive while the temperature was really hot. He didn’t notice that he was losing his attention of the road because he focused his mind on meeting his girlfriend. He fainted and caused a big accident that kill three kids and two parents of other kids. Humans make mistakes and therefore there are engineers to try to reduce these problems that we face every day.   

•	Project description: Using Arduino Uno with temperature sensor, red led, green led, button and a buzzer. The temperature sensor sends in temperature to the Arduino. The Arduino checks the temperature and once it reaches a certain temperature that was picked then the red led and the buzzer will go off. Two choses at this point wait for the temperature to drop and it will stop or click the button to shut the buzzer off and the green light comes on.

•	Project goal: The goal is to test the temperature of the car and checks if it is a safe environment for the driver to drive in to reduce any damage or accidents. The buzzer and the led comes on to warn the driver about the temperature of the car is too hot to drive in. The goal of the button is to shut off the buzzer and also it will open the windows to speed up the process of cooling the car. The windows going down is presents by the green led.

•	Future for this Project:  We would like to use Raspberry Pi because it will give us more chances to work with wireless plus we can be able to connect to a phone also. Other next idea is having the Raspberry Pi to be connected with all the seat belts in the car, so it will detect that there someone still in the car and it will send a message to the owner that will let him/her know that the temperature is getting hot and they need to get their attention to the person in the car. Also, we will have it working with the new cars with remote start. Once your remote start your car then the Raspberry Pi will send a message to let you know that what is the temperature right now and once the timer of the remote starter stops then the Raspberry Pi will send another message to let you know what is the current temperature, so you have the chose to turn it on again or go to the car.
